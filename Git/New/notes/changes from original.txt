1)
Removed the game mechanic of players having a certain number of trains which
dictated the end of the game.
The game will now end when there are no more tracks left. I think this change is 
reasonable because the game board is not so big that train count is needed to 
determine the end of the game. Also since it will be a lot of AI vs AI they 
dont care how long the game lasts; they "have nothing better to do".

2)
DTM will now only include information availiable to the player who the DTM will
be created for. This will reduce the feature set and allow for interpertation to 
be seperate for each player. 
My fear with this is that we will lose important data related to the game state
but the reason I went ahead with this change anyway is beacuse I think it will be
more important to be able to evaluate and distinguish the DTM for each player 
from the same game.
